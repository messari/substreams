/// HasAddresser has been implemented already for all substreams::store's for convenience.
/// So if you know a given store module contains the list of addresses you want to filter by
/// you can pass it directly as a HasAddresser. In this case, the addresses need to be the store key
/// hex encoded as a string including the leading 0x. The value of the store is ignored.
