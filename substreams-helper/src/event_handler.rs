/// Utility struct to easily filter events and assign them handlers.
///
/// Usage:
/// ```
/// let eh = EventHandler::new(&block);
/// eh.filter_by_address(store); // This is optional, if omitted it will handle all events that match the type, independently of the emitting contract.
/// eh.on::<Transfer, _>(&mut on_transfer);
/// eh.on::<Approval, _>(&mut on_approval);
/// eh.on::<Mint, _>(&mut on_mint);
/// eh.on::<Burn, _>(&mut on_burn);
/// eh.handle_events(); // this will run all handlers
/// ```
///
/// You'll likely want to mutate some value from the handlers that is in the current scope.
/// For that, make your handlers be closures, that close over the variable you want to mutate, and have the whole
/// EventHandler block of code in its own scope (either by wrapping it in an aux function or by wrapping it in {...})
///
/// Like so:
/// ```
/// let mut balances : Vec<Balance> = vec![];
/// {
///     let mut on_transfer = |/*...*/| {
///         // this handler modifies `balances`
///         balances.push(some_balance);
///     };
///     let eh = EventHandler::new(&block);
///     eh.on::<Transfer, _>(&mut on_transfer);
///     eh.handle_events();
/// }
///
/// // do whatever else with `balances` here.
/// ```
