## Workflow

### Messari Command line interface

- To install run: `make install-cli`
- Two commands are currently available:
    - `messari init`
    -  `messari add abi`
- Use `--help` flag for details around providing args in the command line
- If any args are left blank the CLI will ask you for the necessary information when needed

###  Logging

- [Rust Logging](https://docs.rs/log/0.4.14/log/)
- Logging can be done using the standard `log` crate, or using the `slog` crate.
- **Note** that `substreams` does not cache the logs. If you want to see logs, you may need to make a change to your substreams code, so that a new binary will be generated - otherwise, this substream will just stream the cached data from the first execution without the logs.
